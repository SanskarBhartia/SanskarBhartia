Hi I'm Sanskar Bhartia a junior at UC Davis majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm interested in the field of data science and analytics. I'm looking forward to collaborating with people on several projects. I hope to land cool internships in the future to work on some upcoming technologies.
